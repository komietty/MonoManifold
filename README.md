## Features
This library contains vector field generator on mesh and its oparators. For general simplical-complex oparation, it contains *Halfedge Structure* as its very core structure, which can be used as standalone module. Based on it, this lib has features below.
- Curvature culclation
- Poisson equation solver
- Hodge decomposition
- Hamonic basis finder
- Homology basis finder 
- Trivial connection generator
- Ribbon drawings on vector field
