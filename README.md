## Features
- Halfedge structure (as very core and standalone module)
- Curvature culclation (Gausian / Mean / Principal / Normal)
- Vector field generator by solving Poisson equation on mesh
- Hodge decomposition for a given tangent field 
- Basis finder for Hamonic component
- Basis finder for Homology group
- Trivial connection generator
- Ribbon drawer on a given vector field 

## Installation & Usage
For installation, put the following address to UnitPackageManager.
