# unity-halfedge

Unity halfedge handler library and some applications based on it. 

## Applications 
### Curvature Culclation

Each of meshes below shows Gausian / Mean / Principal / Normal curvatures respectively. It also contains GPU Gaussian curvature demo.

### Smoothing Culclation
By solving the Poisson's equation on halfedges it enables mesh smoothing. <img src="Imgs/smoothing.gif"/>
